> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This is a âœ¨ vibe-coding âœ¨ project I started because I wanted a rapid way to summarize and extract critical intelligence information from articles I read on the internet. Because I am not a developer by trade, and I am heavily relying on AI Agents to support my develoment of this platform, bugs and issues are expected. Use at your own risk and enjoy the process. If you have suggestions on how to improve the project, please let me know!

## Development Status

This project is in active development. Features are being implemented incrementally, and the codebase is evolving. Known issues are documented in the [Known Issues](Known%20Issues.md) file. If you are a fan of this project and want to see it keep growing, consider adding some fuel to the tank.

## Database Structure

The application uses a SQLite database to store analysis results and metadata. The database structure is as follows:

### Tables

- `analysis_results`: Stores analysis results with metadata
- `analysis_history`: Tracks analysis history and usage statistics
- `blocked_domains`: Lists domains blocked from analysis

### Database Functions

- `create_database()`: Initializes the database and creates tables
- `migrate_database()`: Migrates the database schema to the latest version
- `save_analysis_result()`: Saves analysis results to the database
- `get_analysis_result()`: Retrieves analysis results from the database
- `get_analysis_history()`: Retrieves analysis history from the database
- `update_analysis_history()`: Updates analysis history with usage statistics
- `is_domain_blocked()`: Checks if a domain is blocked from analysis

## Security Notes

- Ensure that your OpenAI API key is kept secure and not exposed in the code or version control system.
- The application includes a domain blocking system to prevent analysis of known malicious or phishing websites. Blocked domains are stored in `app/data/blocked_domains.txt`.
- The application uses environment variables for configuration, which can be set in a `.env` file in the project root.

## Testing

The application includes a testing suite to ensure functionality and reliability. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Startup Optimizations

To optimize startup time and performance, consider the following options:

- Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of the built-in Flask server.
- Enable caching for static assets to reduce server load.
- Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets.
- Optimize database queries and indexing for faster data retrieval.
- Monitor and optimize resource usage to ensure optimal performance.
