A web-based tool that uses AI to aid in rapid summarization and analysis of cybersecurity articles to generate structured threat intelligence insights.

## Current Status

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This is a âœ¨ vibe-coding âœ¨ project I started because I wanted a rapid way to summarize and extract critical intelligence information from articles I read on the internet. Because I am not a developer by trade, and I am heavily relying on AI Agents to support my develoment of this platform, bugs and issues are expected. Use at your own risk and enjoy the process. If you have suggestions on how to improve the project, please let me know!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration values including your OpenAI API key
```
