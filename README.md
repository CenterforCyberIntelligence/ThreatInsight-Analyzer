> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This is a âœ¨ vibe-coding âœ¨ project I started because I wanted a rapid way to summarize and extract critical intelligence information from articles I read on the internet. Because I am not a developer by trade, and I am heavily relying on AI Agents to support my develoment of this platform, bugs and issues are expected. Use at your own risk and enjoy the process. If you have suggestions on how to improve the project, please let me know!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration values including your OpenAI API key
```

## Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# OpenAI Model Configuration
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Available models with their descriptions (JSON format)
AVAILABLE_MODELS={"gpt-4o-mini":{"name":"GPT-4o mini","recommended_for":"Quick analysis of news articles and blog posts"},"gpt-4o":{"name":"GPT-4o","recommended_for":"Detailed analysis of technical reports and research papers"},"gpt-4-turbo":{"name":"GPT-4.5 Turbo","recommended_for":"In-depth analysis of complex threat reports and intelligence briefs"}}

# Model Parameters
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.1
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=4000

# Flask Application Settings
FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0
FLASK_PORT=8000
FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

### URL Validation Configuration

The application includes a robust URL validation system introduced in version 1.0.1. You can customize the validation rules by editing the following constants in `app/blueprints/analysis.py`:

```python
# List of allowed top-level domains
ALLOWED_TLDS = [
    'com', 'org', 'net', 'gov', 'edu', 'mil', 'int', 'io', 'co',
    'uk', 'ca', 'au', 'eu', 'de', 'fr', 'jp', 'ru', 'cn', 'in',
    'br', 'mx', 'za', 'ch', 'se', 'no', 'dk', 'fi', 'nl', 'be'
]

# List of blocked domains (e.g., known malicious sites)
BLOCKED_DOMAINS = [
    'example-malicious-site.com',
    'known-phishing-domain.net'
    # Add more as needed
]
```

To enhance security:
1. Add known malicious domains to the `BLOCKED_DOMAINS` list
2. Restrict the `ALLOWED_TLDS` list to only necessary top-level domains
3. The validator enforces HTTP/HTTPS protocols only and rejects other schemes

## Available Models

The tool supports three OpenAI models with different price points and capabilities:

- **GPT-4o mini** ($0.15/1M tokens)
  - Quick analysis of news articles
  - Best for basic content analysis

- **GPT-4o** ($0.50/1M input, $1.50/1M output)
  - Detailed technical analysis
  - Good balance of speed and depth

- **GPT-4 Turbo** ($10/1M input, $30/1M output)
  - In-depth analysis of complex reports
  - Best for critical assessments

## Running the Application

Start the Flask server:
```bash
python run.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Usage

1. Enter a URL to analyze
2. Select your preferred OpenAI model
3. View the structured analysis results, including:
   - Article summary
   - Source evaluation
   - MITRE ATT&CK techniques
   - Threat actors identified
   - Critical infrastructure sector relevance
4. Export the analysis in your preferred format (JSON, CSV, PDF, or Markdown) using the download button in the analysis results

## Development Status

This project is a work-in-progress, and many features are still being refined. The code is shared in its current state to demonstrate the concept and gather feedback. Please review the Known Issues document for a list of identified issues. If you like this project, consider buying me a coffee!

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite for data storage with the following schema design:

### Tables

1. **articles** - Stores metadata about analyzed articles
   - `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier
   - `url`: TEXT UNIQUE - The URL of the analyzed article
   - `title`: TEXT - The title of the article
   - `content_length`: INTEGER - Length of the extracted content
   - `extraction_time`: REAL - Time taken to extract content (seconds)
   - `analysis_time`: REAL - Time taken to analyze content (seconds)
   - `model`: TEXT - The OpenAI model used for analysis
   - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP - When the analysis was created

2. **analysis_results** - Stores the actual analysis content
   - `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier
   - `article_id`: INTEGER - Foreign key to articles table
   - `raw_text`: TEXT - Raw text response from the AI
   - `structured_data`: TEXT - JSON-formatted structured analysis

3. **token_usage** - Tracks OpenAI API token usage
   - `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier
   - `model`: TEXT - The model used
   - `input_tokens`: INTEGER - Number of input tokens
   - `output_tokens`: INTEGER - Number of output tokens
   - `cached`: BOOLEAN - Whether the result was cached
   - `timestamp`: TIMESTAMP - When the tokens were used

4. **indicators** - Stores extracted indicators of compromise
   - `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier
   - `article_id`: INTEGER - Foreign key to articles table
   - `indicator_type`: TEXT - Type of indicator (ipv4, domain, etc.)
   - `value`: TEXT - The actual indicator value
   - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP - When the indicator was extracted

### Database Functions

The application includes several helper functions for database operations:

- `get_db_connection()`: Context manager for secure database connections
- `execute_query()`: Safe execution of parameterized SQL queries
- `init_db()`: Initialize the database schema if it doesn't exist
- `store_analysis()`: Store new analysis results
- `update_analysis()`: Update existing analysis results
- `get_analysis_by_url()`: Retrieve analysis by article URL
- `get_recent_analyses()`: Get the most recent analyses
- `track_token_usage()`: Record OpenAI API token usage
- `get_token_usage_stats()`: Retrieve token usage statistics
- `store_indicators()`: Store extracted indicators
- `get_indicators_by_article_id()`: Get indicators for a specific article
- `get_indicators_by_url()`: Get indicators by article URL
- `get_indicator_stats()`: Get statistics about extracted indicators

All database operations use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and include proper error handling. The database is automatically initialized when the application starts.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` or any files containing API keys
- Review `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive data is excluded
- Monitor token usage and costs
- All analyses should be validated by a qualified analyst
- Database operations use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
- URL validation prevents malicious input and blocks potentially dangerous domains
- User inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest. To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have the development dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests with coverage report:
   ```
   pytest
   ```
   
   This will run all tests and generate a coverage report. For more detailed options:
   ```
   # Run with verbose output
   pytest -v
   
   # Run specific test file
   pytest tests/test_article_analyzer.py
   
   # Run tests matching a pattern
   pytest -k "analyzer or extractor"
   
   # Generate HTML coverage report
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```

3. View test coverage:
   After running the tests with coverage, open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to see the detailed coverage report.

4. Test categories:
   The tests are organized by categories using pytest markers:
   ```
   # Run only unit tests
   pytest -m unit
   
   # Run only integration tests
   pytest -m integration
   
   # Run only database-related tests
   pytest -m database
   ```

## Disclaimer

This tool uses AI to analyze cybersecurity articles. Results may vary between analyses of the same content.
