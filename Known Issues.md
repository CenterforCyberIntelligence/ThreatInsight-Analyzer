# Known Issues

> This document contains known issues in the codebase identified with the assistance of an AI agent. I'm aware of these issues and plan to address them in future development iterations.

## Security Issues

### 1. Lack of Input Validation 
**File**: `app/blueprints/analysis.py`

I need to implement robust URL validation before processing user input. Currently, the application accepts URLs without proper validation, which could potentially lead to injection attacks or other security issues. I plan to:
- Add a validation library like `validators` to ensure URLs are properly formatted
- Implement allowed domain patterns or other security checks
- Add sanitization for any user-provided inputs

### 2. Unsafe SQL Queries
**File**: `app/models/database.py`

Some database operations in the codebase may be using string formatting instead of parameterized queries. This creates a potential SQL injection vulnerability that needs to be addressed by:
- Converting all string-formatted queries to parameterized queries
- Implementing proper escaping for any dynamic parts of queries
- Adding a database access layer to standardize query handling

### 3. XSS Vulnerabilities in Templates
**File**: `templates/partials/analysis_result.html`

I've identified potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities where unfiltered content is rendered in templates using the `|safe` filter. This could allow malicious content to be executed in users' browsers. To fix this, I need to:
- Remove `|safe` filters where not absolutely necessary
- Implement proper HTML sanitization for user-generated content
- Use safer alternatives like specific escaping functions for formatting

## Performance Issues

### 4. Inefficient Token Usage Calculation
**File**: `app/models/database.py`

The current implementation calculates token usage statistics on-demand with complex queries that may become inefficient as the database grows. I should:
- Implement a caching strategy for token usage statistics
- Consider incremental updates instead of recalculating them each time
- Look into materialized views or pre-calculated values for frequently accessed statistics

### 5. Synchronous OpenAI API Calls
**File**: `app/utilities/article_analyzer.py`

API calls to OpenAI are currently made synchronously, which blocks the request thread and impacts user experience for longer operations. I need to:
- Implement asynchronous API calls using async/await
- Consider using a task queue like Celery for long-running tasks
- Set up a proper background job system for analysis tasks

### 6. Inefficient Article Extraction
**File**: `app/utilities/article_extractor.py`

The current article extraction process tries multiple methods sequentially, which can be slow and inefficient. I should improve this by:
- Implementing parallel extraction attempts when possible
- Caching extracted content to avoid repeated processing
- Refining extraction algorithms based on domain patterns

## Database Issues

### 7. SQLite for Production Use
**File**: `app/config/config.py`

I'm currently using SQLite, which may not scale well for production use. While fine for development, I should consider:
- Migrating to a more robust database like PostgreSQL for production
- Implementing proper connection pooling
- Adding configuration options to easily switch between database types

### 8. Lack of Database Migrations
**Issue**: There's a manual migration script but no proper migration framework.

The current codebase includes a basic migration script but lacks a structured migration framework. I should:
- Implement a proper database migration tool like Alembic or Flask-Migrate
- Set up versioned migrations for all schema changes
- Create proper documentation for the migration process

### 9. Type Mismatch Errors in Database
**File**: `logs/error.log`

There are several "datatype mismatch" errors appearing in the logs, indicating inconsistencies in the database schema. I need to:
- Review the database schema and ensure consistent types
- Add proper type checking and validation before database operations
- Fix the specific queries causing the errors

## Error Handling Issues

### 10. Inconsistent Error Handling
**Issue**: Error handling is implemented inconsistently across the application.

The application needs a more unified approach to error handling. I should:
- Implement a consistent error handling strategy across all modules
- Create custom exception classes for different error types
- Ensure errors are properly logged and presented to users in a consistent way

### 11. Insufficient Error Logging
**File**: `app/utilities/logger.py`

The current logging implementation doesn't consistently capture context or stack traces. I need to:
- Enhance the logging system to include more context with errors
- Add request IDs to logs for easier debugging and tracing
- Consider implementing structured logging for better analysis

## UI/UX Issues

### 12. Modal Refresh Confirmation Needs Improvement
**File**: `templates/partials/analysis_result.html`

The refresh confirmation modal lacks clear feedback and error handling states. I should:
- Add proper error states to the modal
- Improve the loading animation and user feedback
- Implement timeout handling for long-running operations

### 13. Inconsistent UI Element Styling
**File**: `static/css/styles.css`

The CSS has some inconsistent naming patterns and potential specificity issues. I plan to:
- Standardize CSS naming conventions (possibly using BEM methodology)
- Review CSS specificity and reorganize rules more systematically
- Consider implementing a CSS preprocessor like SASS

### 22. Template Rendering Error in IOC Display
**File**: `templates/partials/analysis_result.html`

The error log shows a template rendering error: `TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not iterable` at line 267 when trying to iterate over `type.values`. This suggests a data structure mismatch between what the template expects and what is being provided. I need to:
- Fix the data structure passed to the template to ensure proper format
- Add defensive coding in templates to check if attributes exist and are iterable
- Ensure consistent indicator data structure throughout the application
- Add proper error handling for missing or malformed indicator data

## Configuration Issues

### 14. Hardcoded Configuration Values
**Issue**: Some configuration values are hardcoded rather than using environment variables.

I need to improve configuration management by:
- Moving all configuration values to environment variables
- Implementing a more robust configuration management system
- Setting up a hierarchy of configuration sources

### 15. Inconsistent Model Configuration
**File**: `.env` and `app/config/config.py`

The logs show that the configured OpenAI model (gpt-4o) doesn't match what's actually used (gpt-4o-2024-08-06). I should:
- Update configurations to match actual model names
- Add handling for model versioning
- Implement validation for model names against the OpenAI API

## Code Organization Issues

### 16. Large Function Definitions
**File**: `app/utilities/article_analyzer.py`

Some functions in the codebase are quite large and handle multiple responsibilities. I plan to:
- Refactor large functions into smaller, more focused ones
- Apply the Single Responsibility Principle more consistently
- Create additional utility classes or modules for related functionality

### 17. Duplicated Code in Templates
**Issue**: There's duplicated code across multiple template files.

I should improve template organization by:
- Extracting common elements into reusable template partials
- Implementing template inheritance more effectively
- Using macros for repetitive UI elements

## Dependency Management Issues

### 18. Fixed Dependency Versions
**File**: `requirements.txt`

The current requirements file uses fixed versions which could lead to outdated dependencies or security vulnerabilities. I need to:
- Implement a regular dependency update process
- Consider using dependency ranges rather than fixed versions
- Add a dependency scanning tool to the development pipeline

### 19. Missing Development Dependencies
**Issue**: Development-specific dependencies aren't separated from production dependencies.

I should improve dependency management by:
- Creating separate requirements files for development and production
- Considering using poetry or pipenv for more robust dependency management
- Properly documenting the development setup process

## Operational Issues

### 20. Manual Server Restart Procedure
**File**: `app/blueprints/settings.py`

The current server restart implementation uses a custom procedure that may not work in all deployment environments. I should:
- Replace this with proper process management using tools like supervisord or systemd
- Document deployment and restart procedures properly
- Implement graceful restart capabilities

### 21. Missing Monitoring and Metrics
**Issue**: The application lacks monitoring and metrics collection.

For better operational visibility, I need to:
- Implement application metrics collection
- Add health check endpoints
- Set up integration with monitoring tools

### 23. Missing Extraction Fallbacks
**File**: `app/utilities/article_extractor.py`

The error logs show several cases where content extraction failed with "content too short" errors. I need to:
- Implement more robust fallback mechanisms for content extraction
- Add support for different types of websites and content structures
- Improve error handling when extraction fails
- Consider using a more advanced extraction library or service as a fallback
